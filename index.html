              <li>Discord is a popular communication platform that allows communities of different sizes—from small
                groups of friends to large global communities—to communicate over voice, text or video.</li>
              <li>Individual communities are called <strong>Servers</strong> and can be kept invite-only or made
                publicly discoverable on the internet, then they're divided into text or voice rooms called
                <strong>Channels</strong>
              </li>
              <li>Discord has many features that social networks have (like Friends and Direct Messaging), but is more
                of a chat application as opposed to a website with a feed (like Twitter or Facebook)</li>
              <li>Discord is <strong>psuedonymous</strong> and users aren't required to use their real name</strong>
              </li>
              <li>Each server allows administrator and moderator privileges to be assigned by the owner or creator of
                that Server - these permissions include muting, kicking and banning from specific servers, but do not
                apply outside of that specific server</li>
              <li>Users must be aged 13 or older to use Discord</li>
              <li>Discord also has their own <a href="https://discord.com/terms">Terms of Service</a>, <a

        <p>Discord is especially popular amongst school students who want to find ways to interact with their classmates
          outside of school, especially during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Social communication</li>
          <li>Online gaming</li>
          <li>Study and learning</li>

        <h4 id="student-hubs">What are Discord Student Hubs?</h4>
        <div class="columns">
          <div class="column">
            <p>Student Hubs are <strong>automatically-generated groupings</strong> of students on Discord from the same
              school, based on the school email address they provide to Discord.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>They allow students to find each other and add school-related Servers to a central location</li>
              <li>Discord Student Servers allow the option of replacing pseudonyms with real names to help students find
                each other</li>
              <li>This all takes place on a student's personal Discord account and allow them to connect their self-run
                Servers</li>
              <li>Students and schools have <strong>no control</strong> over Student Hubs – they are
                automatically-generated and managed solely by Discord</li>

          <div class="column">
            <ul>
              <li>Discord provides a pop-up window for students to input and verify their <strong>school email
                  address</strong> (e.g student@school.edu)</li>
              <li>School email addresses are only used to verify which student hub someone may access – it won't be
                visible to other Discord users nor shared with institutions</li>
              <li>Student Hubs are already live for most schools in Australia and are currently rolling out to colleges
                in the USA and Canada. It is now possible for students in many countries across the world to add their
                school to the hubs waitlist.</li>
              <li>Invite links to each institution's Student Hub are sent to school emails and can only be used by
                accounts which have verified their corresponding institutional email address</li>
              <li>Students can opt-out by leaving the Student Hub</li>

        <h4 id="moderation">How do schools moderate Discord?</h4>
        <strong>You should not be worried about students using Discord</strong> - it is a great way for students to
        communicate and connect, especially during the coronavirus pandemic. Like most social media networks (e.g
        Twitter, Facebook) and personal chat applications (e.g WhatsApp, Messenger) there is no easy way for
        institutions to manage or moderate the actions of their students.
        <ul>
          <li>There is <strong>no easy way</strong> for schools to moderate Student Hubs or any aspect of Discord - it
            is a personal communication platform</li>
          <li>Student Hubs are <strong>not managed or affiliated with schools</strong></li>
          <li>Most school internet filtering systems already block Discord and other communication platforms, including
            Palo Alto Networks - but this will not prevent students from accessing Discord in personal home network
            environments</li>
          <li><strong>Our recommendation:</strong> talk to your students about your school's support and encouragement
            of safe online communication, provide resources against cyber-bullying and online abuse, and make clear your
            institution's policies towards online abuse between students at your school</li>
          <li>Although individual servers have their own moderation permissions, you can report abuse on the Discord
            platform to their <a href="https://discord.com/safety/360044103651-Reporting-problems-to-Discord">Trust and
              Safety team</a></li>

          <div class="column">
            <ul>
              <li>Australian schools are some of the first to gain access to the new Discord Student Hubs feature</li>
              <li>Public state education systems, including in New South Wales and Victoria, all use the same email
                address (e.g firstname.lastname@education.nsw.gov.au)</li>
              <li>As a consequence, students will have received <a
                  href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/pnr3ja/when_the_discord_school_hub_goes_live_for_a/">many
                  invites</a> to schools across their state's public education system - this was poor oversight on
                Discord's behalf and <strong>students do not have any control over this</strong></li>
